## The process
### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript

### What I learned

I have learned how to work with the Document Object Model (DOM) events to make the webpage dynamic. 

### Continued development
I want to greatly focus on events handling in order to be able to make my website more dynamic, and I am also looking forward to sharpen my Javascript skills. For the nice designs, I want to focus greatly on advance CSS properties.

### Useful resources

- [Javascript.Info](https://javascript.info/events-change-input)- This website helped me alot in understanding the different betweent 'onchange' and 'oninput' events as used in input parameters.
